Control your presentations from anywhere on your local network! This lightweight Python application shares input from a physical presentation remote connected to one computer, allowing you to control slideshow software running on another machine.

It also enables a networked client device (like another laptop, tablet, or phone) to act as an advanced presentation clicker, complete with a virtual spotlight feature to highlight content and engage your audience.

Ideal for:

Multi-display or multi-computer presentation setups.
Controlling a presentation from a separate device for more freedom of movement.
Enhancing audience engagement with a dynamic virtual spotlight.
Features:

Share standard presentation commands (next, previous, blank screen) across the network.
Client application can act as a sophisticated remote control.
Integrated virtual spotlight functionality controllable via the client app.
Lightweight and Python-based for ease of use and modification.
